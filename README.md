This is a checklist / to-do list built with React, as I try to learn the framework.

Currently, the functionality of adding new list items is basically the method from the example on the official [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I will build and implement more features including removing/"checking off" items, selecting a group of items to remove, and numbering the items in the list.
